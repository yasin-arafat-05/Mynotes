# Working Of SCR

When Gate is Open Circuited
When no voltage applied to gate terminal, junction J2, is reverse biased and the junctions J1 and J3 are forward biased. Since one of the three junctions is reverse biased so there is no current can flow through the load, hence the SCR is OFF. However if the applied voltage is gradually increased, a stage is reached, when reverse biased junction (J2) breaks down. The SCR now, starts conducting and become ON. The value of applied voltage at which the reverse biased junction breaks down and the SCR becomes ON is known as Breakover Voltage.

When Gate is Positive with Respect to Cathode
The SCR can be turned ON at smaller applied voltage by the application of a small positive voltage at the gate terminal. When gate voltage is applied the junction J3 is forward biased and junction J2 is reverse biased. Thus, the electrons from n – type layer starts moving across the junction J3 toward p –type material and the holes from p –type material towards the n – type material. Due to the movement of holes and electrons across the junction J3 the gate current starts flowing. Because of gate current the anode current increases. The increased anode current makes the more electrons available at the junction J2. As a result of this process, in a small time, the junction J2 breaks down and the SCR is turn ON.

Even if the voltage at the gate terminal is removed, the SCR the anode current does not decrease. The SCR can only be turned off by reducing the applied voltage to zero.
