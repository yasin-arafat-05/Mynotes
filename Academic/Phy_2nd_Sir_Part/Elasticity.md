# Elasticity

When a crystalline body is at equilibrium, is subjected to an external force, the force tends to (ধাবিত করে) displace the particle within
the body (particle may be atoms,ions or molecules) from their equilibrium position as a result body deformed. However, 
the altered condition of the body opposed by a restoring force which builds up to balancs the external force.
When the applied force is released, the restoring force brings the particles back to the equilibrium position. 
The property by virtue(এই ধরনের গুন) of which a body regains its orginal state when the deforming forces is withdarwn is knows as elasticity.


# Different kinds of stress

Defination: A stress measures the effectiveness() of a force in producing deformation, stress is always defined as the force exerted() per unit area of the body(F/A).
