# What is Polarization?


Polarization refers to the phenomenon where the oscillations of a wave, such as light or 
electromagnetic waves, occur predominantly in a specific direction. This phenomenon is particularly 
relevant in the context of transverse waves, where the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction 
of wave propagation.
