**Software Project Management (SPM):**
SPM is about managing the process of creating software to ensure it’s done on time, within budget, and meets quality standards.

**Key Points of a Project:**
- **Unique Goal:** Each project has its own specific purpose.
- **Temporary:** Projects have a start and end.
- **Needs Resources:** Projects require time, money, and people.

**Software Project:** 
It’s the entire process of creating software, from gathering what the customer wants to testing and maintaining the software, done within a set time.

**Why SPM is Important:**
Software development changes fast, and every client has different needs. SPM helps manage risks, stay on budget, and deliver the project on time.

**Software Project Manager's Job:**
- Leads the team and communicates with everyone involved.
- Organizes resources (people, money, time) and monitors the progress.
- Ensures the project is completed on time, within budget, and meets quality goals.

**Important SPM Activities:**
1. **Planning:** Deciding what needs to be done before starting.
2. **Scope Management:** Clearly defining what is included in the project and controlling changes to avoid delays and cost overruns.

# `# Project Estimation: `

**Project Estimation :**

Project estimation is crucial for managing software projects effectively. It involves estimating the following:


`Estimation করা একজন project manager কাছে খুরুত্বর্পূন । কম বাজেটে কীভাবে সেইটা তৈরি করবে । তা জানার জন্য । `


1. **Software Size Estimation:**  
`coding line বেশি হলে তার দাম ও বেশি হবে । kilo-> হাজার লাইন দিয়ে `
   - Estimate the size using either KLOC (Kilo Line of Code) or Function Points (FPs).  
   - **KLOC:** Depends on coding practices. `coder's coding practices` 
   - **FPs:** Vary based on user or software requirements.  `business logic`


2. **Effort Estimation:**  
   - Estimate the number of people and hours needed to create the software.
   - Efforts are based on the size of the software and can be derived from experience, past projects, or standard formulas.


3. **Time Estimation:**  
   - Break down the project into smaller tasks (using Work Breakdown Structure) and estimate the time required for each task.  
   - Total time = Sum of time needed for all tasks.

4. **Cost Estimation:**  
   - Most complex because it depends on various factors like:
     - Size of the software
     - Software quality
     - Hardware, tools, licenses
     - Skilled personnel
     - Communication, travel, and training costs

## **Project Estimation Techniques:**

1. **Decomposition Technique:**
   - Break down the project into smaller components and estimate based on:
     - **Line of Code (LOC)**
     - **Function Points (FPs)**

2. **Empirical Estimation Technique:**
   - Uses formulas based on experience or previous projects.
   - Two models:
     - **Putnam Model:** Uses a graph to show the relationship between time and effort.
     - **COCOMO Model:** Divides software into 3 categories (organic, semi-detached, embedded) and uses a formula for estimating time and cost.


### `**Project Scheduling:**`
- It’s a detailed plan of what activities need to be done, in what order, and within a given time.
- Tasks are broken down into smaller tasks.
- Tasks that must be done in a specific sequence are on the "critical path" and need to be finished on time.
- Time and resources are allocated to each task to complete the project on time.

### `**Resource Management:**`
- Resources = people, tools, and software needed to complete the project.
- You need to manage these resources carefully to avoid delays or extra costs.
- Allocate resources when needed and release them when no longer necessary.

### `**Project Risk Management:**`
- Risks are issues that could harm the project, like staff leaving, misinterpreting requirements, or tech changes.
- Steps for risk management:
  1. **Identify:** List all possible risks.
  2. **Categorize:** Group risks as high, medium, or low.
  3. **Manage:** Plan how to handle or avoid risks.
  4. **Monitor:** Keep track of risks and ensure actions are working.

### `**Project Execution & Monitoring:**`
- The project is executed according to the plan.
- You monitor activities, check progress, and adjust if something goes wrong.
  - **Activity Monitoring:** Track daily tasks.
  - **Status Reports:** Report if tasks are completed or ongoing.
  - **Milestone Checklist:** Track major project steps (milestones).

### `**Project Communication Management:**`
- Communication is key for success. Keep everyone updated.
- Steps:
  1. **Planning:** Identify stakeholders and how they’ll communicate.
  2. **Sharing:** Share the right info with the right person at the right time.
  3. **Feedback:** Get input from team and stakeholders.
  4. **Closure:** Officially announce the end of each phase or project completion.

### `**Configuration Management:**`
- Tracks and controls changes in software design, functions, and development.
- Ensures all changes are properly recorded and approved to avoid confusion and mistakes.

### `**Baseline:**`
- A project phase is "baselined" when all activities in that phase are done and documented. It’s like marking the completion of a phase before moving to the next.

### `**Change Control:**`
- Manages how changes are made to the software. Steps:
  1. **Identification:** Document the change request.
  2. **Validation:** Check if the change is valid.
  3. **Analysis:** Analyze its impact on time, cost, and effort.
  4. **Control:** Approve or reject the change.
  5. **Execution:** If approved, implement the change.
  6. **Close request:** Verify the change and close the request.
