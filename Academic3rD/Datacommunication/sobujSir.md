**Communications:** Transfer of data from one entity to another via some form of transmission medium.

**Telecommunication:** Telecommunications means Telecommunication over long distances.
We commonly use the contraction **telecom** with the same meaning.
There are many types of Telecommunication technologies today. **Example:** Radio,TV broadcasting, Telegraphs, Internet, Satellites, Microwave, Fiber Optics, Landline and mobile phones.

**Data Communication or Datacom:** Data communication is the process of sending or receiving digital data between two or more computers via transmission media such as wire cable or wirelessly.

### Components of Data Communication

A data **communications system** has five components.

1. **Message.** The message is the information (data) to be communicated. Popular forms of information include text, numbers, pictures, audio, and video.
2. **Sender.** The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a computer, a telephone handset, a video camera, and so on.
3. **Receiver.** The receiver is the device that receives the message. It can be a computer, workstation, telephone handset, television, and so on.
4. **Transmission medium.** The transmission medium is the physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver. Some examples of transmission media include twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, and radio waves.
5. **Protocol.** A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications. It represents an agreement between the communicating devices. Without a protocol, two devices may be connected but not able to communicate, just as a person speaking French cannot be understood by a person who speaks only Japanese.

### Protocols and Standards


- Protocol
    - A set of rules governing data communications
        - *Syntax:* format of a data block
        - *Semantics:* meaning of each section
        - *Timing:* speed and sequencing
- Standard
    - De facto (in practice) Standards → not approved but widely adopted
    - De jure (in law) Standards → approved by an organization

### Examples of Standard Organizations

List of some major standard bodies

- IEEE - Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers
    - The largest professional group involved in standards for computing, communications, electrical and electronics
- ISO - International Standards Organization
    - An International Standard Organization that develops standard for variety of fields
- ANSI - American National Standards Institute
- IETF - Internet Engineering Task Force
    - A large open international community of network designers, operators, vendors, and researchers concerned with the evolution of the Internet architecture
- ITU - International Telecommunication Union
    - International Telecommunications Union - Telecommunication Standard Sector (ITU-T)
    - International Standard Organization that develops Standard for Telecommunications
    - Some well known Standards
        - V Series
        - X Series
        - H Series
