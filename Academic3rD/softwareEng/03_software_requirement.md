### 2. Requirement analysis and specification (from SDLC)
- Try to understood the exact and complete requirement of the customer and document
them properly.
- Try to collect and analysis all data related to the project.
- In last, a large document will be written in the natural language which will describe what the system will do without describing it how, called SRS Software Requirement
Specification.
- Very critical phase because, a small error hear can result of sever problem in later stages

`customer exactly কি চাচ্ছে তা শুনে document করি । এরপর data collect and analysis করা । এমন একটা document বানানো natural language এ যাতে  বুঝতে পারে আমরা কি কি নিয়ে কাজ করবো । And lastly, this is very critical phase . `

### i) **Requirement Engineering**
Requirement engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining software requirements. It involves understanding what a system needs to do and ensuring that all stakeholders agree on the system's goals.

### ii) **Requirement Engineering Process**
1. **Feasibility Study**: This is an initial evaluation to determine if the project is viable technically, economically, and operationally.
2. **Requirement Gathering**: Collecting requirements from stakeholders, users, and other sources to define the system's needs.
3. **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)**: A detailed documentation of the system’s functional and non-functional requirements.
4. **Software Requirement Validation**: Ensures the documented requirements meet the stakeholders' needs and are feasible, complete, and consistent.

Type of requirement: 
- User requirement
- System requirement

### User requirements:

User requirements are statements in a natural language plus diagrams of what services the System is expected to provide and the constraints under which it must operate . 

(User System এ কি কি  অপারেশন  চাচ্ছে কি হবে তা জানি  )

### System requirements:

System requirement set out the system functions, service and operational constarin in details. The system requirement document(Functional specification) should be precise. It should define exacty what is to be implemented.

(system কি কি  functions perform করবে এর কি কি  contrain থাকবে  বা পারবে না  সেই গুলো থাকবে )

(`Funcitional Requrements: What দিয়ে প্রশ্ন করবো`)


### Functional Requirements:
These are features that describe **what the system should do**. They define specific tasks the software must perform for the users.

Examples:
- **Search Function**: The system should allow users to search through invoices.
- **Email Reports**: Users should be able to email any report to management.
- **User Groups and Permissions**: The system should allow users to be organized into groups with different access rights.
- **Business Rules**: The software must follow the company’s rules and processes.
- **Backward Compatibility**: The software should work with older systems.



(`Non-Funcitional Requrements: How দিয়ে প্রশ্ন করবো`)
### Non-Functional Requirements 
These are requirements related to **how the system performs** rather than specific features. They focus on the system’s quality and performance.

Examples:
- **Security**: The system should be protected from unauthorized access.
- **Logging**: The system should keep track of important actions for future reference.
- **Storage**: The system should have enough space for data.
- **Configuration**: Users should be able to easily configure system settings.
- **Performance**: The system should respond quickly and handle large amounts of data.
- **Cost**: The software should be affordable to operate.
- **Interoperability**: The software should work well with other systems.
- **Flexibility**: The system should be easy to update and adapt to new requirements.
- **Disaster Recovery**: The system should have backups and a plan to recover from failures.
- **Accessibility**: The system should be easy to use for people with different needs.

### Requirement Categories (Simplified)
1. **Must Have**: Critical for the system to work. Without these, the software won’t function.
2. **Should Have**: Important features that improve the software but aren’t essential.
3. **Could Have**: Optional features that are nice to have but not necessary.
4. **Wish List**: Features that are not tied to the core objectives of the software but could be added later.

The focus during development should be on implementing the **Must Have** requirements, debating and discussing the **Should Have** features with stakeholders, while the **Could Have** and **Wish List** items can be added in future updates.

`(Requirement Grather করবো কীভাবে? Requirement Elicitation । )`

### iii) **Requirement Elicitation Process**
1. **Requirement Gathering**: Actively collecting information through various methods like interviews or surveys.
2. **Organizing Requirements**: Structuring and categorizing the collected information.
3. **Negotiation and Discussion**: Stakeholders discuss and resolve conflicting requirements.
4. **Documentation**: Writing down requirements in a formal document that serves as a reference for the entire project.


### iv) **Requirement Elicitation Techniques**
1. **Interviews**: One-on-one discussions to extract requirements directly from stakeholders.
2. **Surveys/Questionnaires**: Using structured questions to gather information from many stakeholders.
3. **Task Analysis**: Studying tasks users perform to understand the system's requirements.
4. **Domain Analysis**: Researching the environment and domain to identify standard practices and needs.
5. **Brainstorming**: Group discussions to generate ideas and clarify requirements.
6. **Prototyping**: Creating a preliminary model of the system to help stakeholders understand requirements better.
7. **Observation**: Watching users interact with the current system to identify requirements for improvement.



### v) **Software Requirement Characteristics**
- **Clear**: Requirements should be understandable by all stakeholders.
- **Correct**: They must accurately reflect the system’s needs.
- **Consistent**: No conflicting requirements.
- **Complete**: All system behaviors and interactions should be covered.
- **Verifiable**: The requirement should be testable to verify implementation.



### vi) **Software Requirements**
1. **Functional Requirements**: Describe what the system should do. Example: "The system must send a notification after a user registers."
2. **Non-Functional Requirements**: Define system attributes like security, reliability, performance, etc. Example: "The system must load in under 2 seconds."


### vii) **User Interface Requirements**
These specify how the system's interface should interact with users, including usability, accessibility, and design guidelines.


### viii) **Software System Analyst**
A system analyst bridges the gap between stakeholders and the development team. They ensure that requirements are correctly understood and implemented.



### ix) **Software Metrics and Measures**
1. **Size Metrics**: Measure the software’s size, typically using lines of code (LOC), function points, etc.
2. **Complexity Metrics**: Assess the complexity of the code or system design (e.g., Cyclomatic complexity).
3. **Quality Metrics**: Evaluate the software’s quality, including defect rates, customer satisfaction, etc.
4. **Process Metrics**: Measure aspects of the software development process such as time spent on different phases.
5. **Resources Metrics**: Track resource usage like time, money, and human effort during the development process.
