# What is Polarization?


Polarization refers to the phenomenon where the oscillations of a wave, such as light or 
electromagnetic waves, occur predominantly in a specific direction. This phenomenon is particularly 
relevant in the context of transverse waves, where the oscillations are perpendicular to the direction 
of wave propagation. Therefore, Polarization is the process transforming the unpolarise light into polarise light.

# Type of Polarization:

There are several types of polarization, each characterized by the specific arrangement of oscillations in a wave. The most common types include:

1. **Linear Polarization**:
   - **Description**: In linear polarization, the oscillations of the wave occur in a straight line along a specific direction. The wave vibrates in one plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation. In linear polarization there is no phase or the phase difference is 180 degree.

   - **Representation**: Represented by an arrow or a line indicating the direction of oscillation.

2. **Circular Polarization**:
   - **Description**:  Circular polarization occurs when the oscillations of the wave follow a circular path to propagates. There are two types of circular polarization: right-handed and left-handed, depending on the direction of rotation. In circular polarization there have phase difference about 90 or 270 degree.

   - **Representation**: Often represented using circular arrows .

3. **Elliptical Polarization**:
   - **Description**:  Elliptical polarization occurs when the oscillations of the wave follow a elliptical path to propagates. Elliptical polarization is a combination of linear and circular polarizations. In elliptical polarization there have phase difference about 0,90,180 or 270 degree.

   - **Representation**: Represented using an ellipse to show the shape and orientation of the oscillation path.
