User interface is the front-end application view to which user interacts in order to use 
the software. User can manipulate and control the software as well as hardware by 
means of user interface.

The software becomes more popular if its user interface is:
- Attractive
- Simple to use
- Responsive in short time
- Clear to understand
- Consistent on all interfacing screens

UI is broadly divided into two categories:
- Command Line Interface
- Graphical User Interface
