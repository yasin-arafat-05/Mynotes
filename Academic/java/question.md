# Differentiate between class variable and an instance variable:


**Class Variable (Static Variable):**

1. **Scope:**
   - **Class Scope:** Class variables are associated with the class itself rather than with instances of the class. They are shared among all instances of the class.
  
2. **Keyword:**
   - **Static Keyword:** Class variables are declared using the `static` keyword.

3. **Memory Allocation:**
   - **Single Copy:** There is only one copy of a class variable that is shared among all instances of the class. It is stored in a common memory location associated with the class.

4. **Initialization:**
   - **Default Initialization:** Class variables are automatically initialized to default values if no explicit initialization is provided.

5. **Access:**
   - **Class Name:** Class variables can be accessed using the class name, e.g., `ClassName.variableName`.

6. **Usage:**
   - **Shared Data:** Class variables are often used to represent shared data or constants across all instances of the class.

**Instance Variable:**

1. **Scope:**
   - **Instance Scope:** Instance variables are associated with an instance of the class. Each instance has its own copy of the instance variables.

2. **Keyword:**
   - **No Static Keyword:** Instance variables are declared without the `static` keyword.

3. **Memory Allocation:**
   - **Per Instance:** Each instance of the class has its own set of instance variables, and they are stored in separate memory locations.

4. **Initialization:**
   - **Explicit Initialization:** Instance variables may be explicitly initialized in the class constructor or methods, and they are not automatically initialized to default values.

5. **Access:**
   - **Object Reference:** Instance variables are accessed using an object reference, e.g., `objectName.variableName`.

6. **Usage:**
   - **Object State:** Instance variables are used to represent the state or attributes of individual objects. Each object has its own values for these variables.

**Summary:**

- Class variables are shared among all instances of a class and are associated with the class itself.
- Instance variables are specific to each instance of a class and represent the state or attributes of individual objects.
- Class variables are declared with the `static` keyword, while instance variables are not.
- Class variables are often used for constants or shared data, whereas instance variables are used to maintain the state of individual objects.
