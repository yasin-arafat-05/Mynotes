**Communications:** Transfer of data from one entity to another via some form of transmission medium.

**Telecommunication:** Telecommunications means Telecommunication over long distances.
We commonly use the contraction **telecom** with the same meaning.
There are many types of Telecommunication technologies today. **Example:** Radio,TV broadcasting, Telegraphs, Internet, Satellites, Microwave, Fiber Optics, Landline and mobile phones.

**Data Communication or Datacom:** Data communication is the process of sending or receiving digital data between two or more computers via transmission media such as wire cable or wirelessly.

### Components of Data Communication

A data **communications system** has five components.

1. **Message.** The message is the information (data) to be communicated. Popular forms of information include text, numbers, pictures, audio, and video.
2. **Sender.** The sender is the device that sends the data message. It can be a computer, a telephone handset, a video camera, and so on.
3. **Receiver.** The receiver is the device that receives the message. It can be a computer, workstation, telephone handset, television, and so on.
4. **Transmission medium.** The transmission medium is the physical path by which a message travels from sender to receiver. Some examples of transmission media include twisted-pair wire, coaxial cable, fiber-optic cable, and radio waves.
5. **Protocol.** A protocol is a set of rules that govern data communications. It represents an agreement between the communicating devices. Without a protocol, two devices may be connected but not able to communicate, just as a person speaking French cannot be understood by a person who speaks only Japanese.

# _______________ Transmission Mode or Data Flow ________________

### Transmission Mode:
Transmission mode means transferring of data between two devices connected over a network. It is also known as **mode of communication** .

There are three types of Transmission mode:
- Simplex
- Half Duplex
- Full Duplex
