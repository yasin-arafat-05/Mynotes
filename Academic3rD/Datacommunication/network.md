**Network:** A network is a set of nodes connected by communication links.
**Node:** A node can be a computer, printer or any other device capable of sending/receiving data generated by other notdes in the network.
**Communication Link:** A communication link can be a wired link or wireless link. The link carries the information.

In order to find out the quality of a network we have some criteria. Based on this 
criteria we will determine the quality of the network. These criteria are:

- Performance
- Reliability
- Security

Certainly! Let's explore the network criteria in the context of data communication from Node A to Node B:

i) **Performance:**
   - **Transit Time:** Transit time, also known as latency or propagation time, is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the source (Node A) to the destination (Node B). It includes the time spent in propagation, transmission, and queuing delays.
   - **Response Time:** Response time is the total time it takes for a system to respond to a given input or request. In the context of data communication, it encompasses transit time along with processing delays at both ends (Node A and Node B).
   - **Throughput:** Throughput is the actual amount of data transferred successfully between Node A and Node B in a given time period. It reflects the efficiency and capacity of the network to handle data transmission.
   - **Delay:** Delay refers to the total time it takes for a message to travel from Node A to Node B. It includes propagation delay, transmission delay, processing delay, and queuing delay.

ii) **Reliability:**
   - **Reliability** in network communication refers to the ability of the network to deliver data accurately and consistently. A reliable network minimizes errors, ensures data integrity, and provides consistent performance over time.

iii) **Security:**
   - **Security** involves protecting the data being transmitted from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. It includes measures such as encryption, authentication, and authorization to ensure that only authorized entities can access or manipulate the data during its journey from Node A to Node B.
