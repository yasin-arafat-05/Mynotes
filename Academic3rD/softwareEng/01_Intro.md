# 1. `What is Software Engineering:`

- `Software: ` Software is a set of instructions or programs that tell a computer how to perform specific tasks. It includes applications, operating systems, and other programs that help users interact with the computer and perform various functions.

- `Engineering: ` It is the application of scientific and practical knowledge to invent, design, build, maintain and improve frameworks, processes, etc. 


**Software Engineering** is the application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software. It involves using scientific and practical knowledge to create reliable, efficient, and scalable software systems that meet user needs and solve real-world problems.


# 2. `Need for Software Engineering:`

- i) **Handling Big Projects:** Software engineering helps in managing large and complex projects by breaking them down into smaller, manageable parts. This makes it easier for teams to work on different sections simultaneously and ensures the project is well-organized.

- ii) **To Manage the Cost:** It helps control the cost of software development by planning ahead, using efficient methods, and avoiding unnecessary work. This ensures the project stays within budget.

- iii) **To Decrease Time:** By using proven methods and tools, software engineering reduces the time needed to build software. This speeds up development, allowing teams to deliver the final product faster.

- iv) **Reliable Software:** It ensures that the software works correctly and consistently without errors. This reliability is achieved through thorough testing and following best practices.

- v) **Effectiveness:** Software engineering makes sure that the software does what it is supposed to do and meets the needs of the users effectively. This ensures the software is useful and solves the intended problems.
