# Software User Interface Design: 

User interface is the front-end application view to which user interacts in order to use 
the software. User can manipulate and control the software as well as hardware by 
means of user interface.

The software becomes more popular if its user interface is:
- Attractive
- Simple to use
- Responsive in short time
- Clear to understand
- Consistent on all interfacing screens

UI is broadly divided into two categories:
- Command Line Interface
- Graphical User Interface


# `CLI: Command Line Interface: `

CLI has been a great tool of interaction with computers until the video display monitors 
came into existence. CLI is first choice of many technical users and programmers. CLI 
is minimum interface a software can provide to its users.

# `# Graphical User Interface:`

Graphical User Interface provides the user graphical means to interact with the system. 
GUI can be combination of both hardware and software. Using GUI, user interprets the 
software.

Typically, GUI is more resource consuming than that of CLI. With advancing technology, 
the programmers and designers create complex GUI designs that work with more 
efficiency, accuracy and speed.



` GUI Element: `

- **Window**: A space where an application's content is displayed. Windows can show files as icons or lists and can be resized, minimized, or moved around the screen. A window may have smaller "child windows" within it.
  
- **Tabs**: A feature allowing multiple documents or views in a single window, used by modern web browsers and other applications to manage multiple instances.

- **Menu**: A collection of commands or options, usually at the top of a window, allowing users to access functions of the application.

- **Icon**: A small image representing an application or file. Clicking it opens the associated program or document.

- **Cursor**: A visual representation of user input devices (e.g., mouse or touchpad). It moves in real-time to interact with different GUI elements like menus and windows.
