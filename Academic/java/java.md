# JVM 
JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist. It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed. It can also run those programs which are written in other languages and compiled to Java bytecode.

**The JVM performs the following main tasks:**

    - Loads code
    - Verifies code
    - Executes code
    - Provides runtime environme
