1. **Cohesive Forces**:
   - **Definition**: Cohesive forces are the attractive forces between molecules of the same type. These forces help hold the substance together and are responsible for the liquid or solid state of a material.
   - **Example**: Water molecules in a liquid state are held together by cohesive forces. This is why water droplets form and water has a tendency to bead up.

2. **Adhesive Forces**:
   - **Definition**: Adhesive forces are the attractive forces between molecules of different types. These forces occur when molecules from different substances are attracted to each other.
   - **Example**: When water adheres to the surface of a glass, adhesive forces between water molecules and the glass molecules are at play. This is often observed in phenomena like capillary action.
