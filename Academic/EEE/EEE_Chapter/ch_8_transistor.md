# Transistors:

A transistor consists of two pn junctions formed by *sandwiching either p-type or n-type semiconductor between a pair of opposite types. Accordingly, there are two types of transistors, namely;
(i) n-p-n transistor (ii) p-n-p transistor

An n-p-n transistor is composed of two n-type semiconductors separated by a thin section of ptype as shown in Fig. 8.1 (i). However, a p-n-p transistor is formed by two p-sections separated by a
thin section of n-type as shown in Fig. 8.1 (ii).

# Naming the Transistor Terminals:

A transistor (pnp or npn) has three sections of doped semiconductors. The section on one side is the
emitter and the section on the opposite side is the collector. The middle section is called the base and
forms two junctions between the emitter and collector.
