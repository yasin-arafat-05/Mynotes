To find the service name associated with the camera app, you can use the `adb shell dumpsys package` command. This command provides detailed information about the packages installed on the device, including the services they contain.

Here's how you can find the service name of the camera app:

1. First, list all packages installed on the device using the `adb shell pm list packages` command.
2. Find the package name corresponding to the camera app.
3. Once you have the package name, use the `adb shell dumpsys package <package_name>` command to get detailed information about that package.
4. Look for the section that lists the services provided by the app. The service name for the camera app should be listed there.

Here's an example of the commands:

```bash
# List all packages
adb shell pm list packages

# Get detailed information about the camera app package
adb shell dumpsys package com.sec.android.app.camera
```

Look for the section that starts with `Services:` in the output of the `dumpsys` command. Under this section, you should find the service name associated with the camera app. Once you have the service name, you can use it in the `am startservice` command as you mentioned.
