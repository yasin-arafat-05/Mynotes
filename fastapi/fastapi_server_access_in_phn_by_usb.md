Given that you want to access your FastAPI server running on your laptop from your Flutter app running on your physical Android device connected via USB, you should use `adb reverse` to forward the necessary port. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Ensure Developer Options and USB Debugging are Enabled on Your Android Device:**
   - Go to `Settings` > `About phone` and tap `Build number` seven times to enable Developer Options.
   - Go to `Settings` > `Developer options` and enable `USB debugging`.

2. **Connect Your Android Device to Your Laptop via USB:**
   - Use a USB cable to connect your Android device to your laptop.

3. **Set Up Port Forwarding Using `adb`:**
   - Open a terminal or Command Prompt on your laptop.
   - Run the following command to set up port forwarding from your device to your laptop:
     ```sh
     adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000
     ```
   - This command forwards traffic from port `8000` on your Android device to port `8000` on your laptop.

4. **Start Your FastAPI Server:**
   - Ensure your FastAPI server is running on your laptop and listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0). Use the following command to start the server:
     ```sh
     uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
     ```

5. **Update Your Flutter App to Use the Correct API Base URL:**
   - Since you are forwarding the port and your device will be accessing the server through `localhost`, the API base URL in your Flutter app should be `http://127.0.0.1:8000`:
   ```dart
   String baseUrl = 'http://127.0.0.1:8000';
   ```

### Example Code Changes in Flutter

Update the API endpoint in your Flutter app to use `127.0.0.1`:
```dart
import 'package:http/http.dart' as http;

void fetchData() async {
  final response = await http.get(Uri.parse('http://127.0.0.1:8000/your-endpoint'));
  if (response.statusCode == 200) {
    print('Data fetched successfully');
  } else {
    print('Failed to fetch data');
  }
}
```

### Summary

1. **Enable USB Debugging on your Android device.**
2. **Connect your Android device to your laptop via USB.**
3. **Run `adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000` to forward the port.**
4. **Start your FastAPI server using `uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`.**
5. **Update the API base URL in your Flutter app to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.**

By following these steps, your Flutter app running on your physical Android device should be able to connect to the FastAPI server running on your laptop.
