# Start An App Using ADB Comand:

 ---
 ---
 ---

To start an app using ADB command, you need to know the package name (also known as the app's identifier) of the app you want to launch. Once you have the package name, you can use the `am start` command with the `-n` option to specify the component name (package name + activity name) of the app you want to launch.

Here's how you can start an app using ADB command:

1. **Find the Package Name:**
   You can find the package name of the app you want to launch by using the `adb shell pm list packages` command. This command will list all the installed packages on your device. You can then search for the package name of the app you want to launch.

   For example, if you want to find the package name of the Google Chrome app, you can run:
   ```
   adb shell pm list packages | grep chrome
   ```

2. **Start the App:**
   Once you have the package name, you can start the app using the `am start` command. You need to specify the component name of the main activity of the app.

   The general syntax is:
   ```
   adb shell am start -n <package_name>/<activity_name>
   ```

   Replace `<package_name>` with the package name of the app and `<activity_name>` with the main activity name of the app.

   For example, to start the Google Chrome app, you can run:
   ```
   adb shell am start -n com.android.chrome/com.google.android.apps.chrome.Main
   ```

3. **Verify the App Launch:**
   After executing the command, the specified app should launch on your device. If successful, you'll see the app's interface on your device screen.

Make sure to replace `<package_name>` and `<activity_name>` with the actual package name and activity name of the app you want to launch. You can find the activity name by looking at the app's manifest file or by using third-party tools like ADB Shell.

If you're unsure about the package name or activity name of the app, feel free to provide the name of the app you want to launch, and I can help you find the appropriate package name and activity name.
