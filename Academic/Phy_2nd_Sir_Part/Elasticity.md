# Elasticity

When a crystalline body is at equilibrium, is subjected to an external force, the force tends to (ধাবিত করে) displace the particle within
the body (particle may be atoms,ions or molecules) from their equilibrium position as a result body deformed. However, 
the altered condition of the body opposed by a restoring force which builds up to balancs the external force.
When the applied force is released, the restoring force brings the particles back to the equilibrium position. 
The property by virtue(এই ধরনের গুন) of which a body regains its orginal state when the deforming forces is withdarwn is knows as elasticity.


# Different kinds of stress

**Defination :** A stress measures the effectiveness(কার্যকারিতা) of a force in producing deformation, stress is always defined as the force exerted(প্রয়োগ) per unit area of the body(F/A).

**Kinds of stress :**

### Stress is generally divided into three types:

i) **Tensile or Longitudinal Stress :** It is the stretching force acting per unit area of the section of the solid acting in the direction of its length.

ii) **Compressive or volume stress :**  It is the uniform force acting per unit area on the faces of a cube.

iii) **Shearing or Tangetial Stress :** It is the force acting tangentially per unit area on the body. 


### Strain is generally divided into three types:

Shearing strain, denoted by the symbol \(γ\) (gamma), is a measure of the change in shape or distortion experienced by a material when subjected to an applied force parallel to one of its surfaces.

Shearing strain is defined as the angular deformation per unit length and is often expressed as a dimensionless quantity. The formula for shearing strain (\(γ\)) is given by:

$\[ γ = \frac{\Delta x}{L} \]$

Where:
- \(γ\) is the shearing strain.
- \(\Delta x\) is the displacement parallel to the applied force.
- \(L\) is the original length perpendicular to the applied force.
