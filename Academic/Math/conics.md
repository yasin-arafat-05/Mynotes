# Parabola:

**Definition of a Parabola:**
A parabola is a conic section, a curve formed by the intersection of a right circular cone and a plane parallel to one of the cone's generating lines. Geometrically, a parabola is defined as the set of all points in a plane that are equidistant from a fixed point (called the focus) and a fixed straight line (called the directrix).

**Properties of a Parabola:**

1. **Focus and Directrix:**
   - The parabola is symmetric with respect to its axis of symmetry, which is a line passing through the focus and the vertex.
   - The distance between the vertex and the focus is the same as the distance between the vertex and the directrix. This distance is called the focal length.

2. **Vertex:**
   - The vertex is the point on the parabola closest to both the focus and the directrix.
   - The axis of symmetry passes through the vertex.

3. **Standard Form Equations:**
   - The standard form of the equation for a parabola with its vertex at the origin is $\(y = ax^2\)$ or $\(x = ay^2\)$, where $\(a\)$ is a constant.
   - When the vertex is at $\((h, k)\)$, the standard form becomes $\(y = a(x - h)^2 + k\)$ or $\(x = a(y - k)^2 + h\)$.

4. **Direction of Opening:**
   - The sign of the coefficient $\(a\)$ in the standard form determines the direction of opening. A positive $\(a\)$ opens the parabola upwards (for $\(y\)$) or to the right (for $\(x\)$), and a negative $\(a\)$ opens it downwards (for $\(y\)$) or to the left (for $\(x\)$).

5. **Latus Rectum:**
   - The latus rectum is a line segment passing through the focus and perpendicular to the axis of symmetry. Its length is equal to the |4a|.

6. **Focal Length:**
   - The focal length is the distance between the focus and the vertex. It is also the distance between the vertex and the directrix.

7. **Tangent and Normal:**
   - The tangent at any point on the parabola is perpendicular to the radius drawn from the point to the focus.
   - The normal at any point on the parabola is perpendicular to the tangent at that point.
