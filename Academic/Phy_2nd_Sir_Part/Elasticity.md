# Elasticity

When a crystalline body is at equilibrium, is subjected to an external force, the force tends to (ধাবিত করে) displace the particle within
the body (particle may be atoms,ions or molecules) from their equilibrium position as a result body deformed. However, 
the altered condition of the body opposed by a restoring force which builds up to balancs the external force.
When the applied force is released, the restoring force brings the particles back to the equilibrium position. 
The property by virtue(এই ধরনের গুন) of which a body regains its orginal state when the deforming forces is withdarwn is knows as elasticity.


# Different kinds of stress

**Defination :** A stress measures the effectiveness(কার্যকারিতা) of a force in producing deformation, stress is always defined as the force exerted(প্রয়োগ) per unit area of the body(F/A).

**Kinds of stress :**

### Stress is generally divided into three types:

i) **Tensile or Longitudinal Stress :** It is the stretching force acting per unit area of the section of the solid acting in the direction of its length.

ii) **Compressive or volume stress :**  It is the uniform force acting per unit area on the faces of a cube.

iii) **Shearing or Tangetial Stress :** It is the force acting tangentially per unit area on the body. 


### Strain is generally divided into three types:


**Defination:** A strain is a measure of deformation.  It is always define as the change in length per unit length.

**Types of strain:**

There are mainly 3 types of strain. 

i) **Tensile or longitudinal strain:** It is the change of length per unit length in the dirction of the length of a rod,
        longitudinal Starain = l/L
where, l is the change produced in this length and L is the orginal length.


ii) **Volume Strain or Bulk Strain:**  Volume strain is a measure of the change in volume experienced by a material when is subjected to an external force or stress. It is defined as the ratio of the change in volume (ΔV) to the original volume (V) of the material.
    Volume Strain = del V/V.
    
iii) **Shearing Strain:**  Shearing strain, denoted by the symbol \(γ\) (gamma), is a measure of the change in shape or distortion experienced by a material when subjected to an applied force parallel to one of its surfaces.

Shearing strain is defined as the angular deformation per unit length and is often expressed as a dimensionless quantity. The formula for shearing strain (\(γ\)) is given by:

$\[ γ = \frac{\Delta x}{L} \]$

Where:
- $\(γ\)$ is the shearing strain.
- $\(\Delta x\)$ is the displacement parallel to the applied force.
- $\(L\)$ is the original length perpendicular to the applied force.


# Hooke's Law:

![Alt text](/Academic/photo/image.png)

**Definition:**
Hooke's Law is a foundational principle in physics, stating that, within the elastic limit, the force required to deform a material by a certain distance is directly proportional to that distance.

**Explanation:**
Hooke's Law applies to a wide range of elastic materials. Let's consider a generic elastic material (not necessarily a spring) experiencing deformation. The law can be expressed as $\(F = -k \cdot x\)$, where:

- $\(F\)$ is the force applied to the material.
- $\(k\)$ is the material's elastic constant, a measure of its stiffness.
- $\(x\)$ is the displacement or deformation from the material's original position.

The negative sign signifies that the force is exerted in the opposite direction to the deformation, reflecting the material's tendency to return to its original state.



# Types of elastic constant 

### i) Young's Modulus (Tensile Elasticity):
**Definition:**
    ![](/Academic/photo/elasticity02.png)
**Explanation:**
When a material is subjected to tensile (pulling or stretching) forces, it undergoes deformation. Young's Modulus (\(E\)) is defined as the ratio of stress $(\(\sigma\))$ to strain $(\(\varepsilon\))$ in the linear elastic region of the material. Mathematically, it's expressed as:

$\[ E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon} \]$


### ii) Bulk Modulus (Volume Elasticity):
**Definition:**
Bulk Modulus measures a material's response to changes in volume under the influence of external pressure.

**Explanation:**
When a material is subjected to uniform pressure, it experiences a change in volume. The Bulk Modulus $(\(K\))$ is defined as the ratio of the change in pressure $(\(P\))$ to the resulting fractional change in volume $(\(V/V_0\))$. Mathematically, it's expressed as:

$\[ K = -\frac{\Delta P}{\frac{\Delta V}{V_0}} \]$

A higher Bulk Modulus indicates a material's resistance to volume changes under pressure. This property is crucial in applications where materials need to withstand changes in pressure without undergoing significant volume deformation.

### iii) Shear Modulus (Simple Rigidity or Shear Elasticity):
**Definition:**
Shear Modulus measures a material's ability to withstand deformation by shear stress.

**Explanation:**
When a material is subjected to parallel forces acting in opposite directions, it undergoes shear deformation. The Shear Modulus $(\(G\))$ is defined as the ratio of shear stress $(\(τ\))$ to shear strain $(\(γ\))$. Mathematically, it's expressed as:

$\[ G = \frac{\tau}{\gamma} \]$

A higher Shear Modulus indicates a material's resistance to shear deformation. This property is significant in applications where materials are subjected to torsional or shearing forces.

### iv) Poisson's Ratio:
**Definition:**
Poisson's Ratio is a dimensionless quantity that describes the ratio of lateral contraction to axial elongation when a material is stretched.

**Explanation:**
When a material is subjected to axial (tensile or compressive) forces, it undergoes both axial elongation and lateral contraction. Poisson's Ratio $(\(ν\))$ is defined as the negative ratio of lateral strain $(\(\varepsilon_{lat}\))$ to axial strain $(\(\varepsilon_{ax}\))$. Mathematically, it's expressed as:

$\[ ν = -\frac{\varepsilon_{lat}}{\varepsilon_{ax}} \]$

Poisson's Ratio ranges from -1 to 0.5. Most materials have positive ratios, indicating lateral contraction under axial tension and vice versa. This property is important in understanding how materials deform under various loading conditions.

In summary, these elasticity constants provide valuable information about how materials respond to different types of external forces and deformations, aiding in the design and analysis of structures and materials.
