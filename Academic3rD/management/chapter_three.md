### **G - Goal-Oriented**
Organising is done to achieve specific goals. For example, if a company wants to increase sales, it will organize teams and tasks to focus on marketing and sales efforts.

### **O - Organization/Hierarchy**
There’s a clear structure where everyone knows their role and who they report to. For instance, in a school, teachers report to the principal, and the principal reports to the school board.

### **F - Flexibility**
Organising allows a company to adjust to changes. For example, if a new technology comes in, the company can change its work process or structure to adapt.

### **I - Intellectual/Analytical**
Organising requires thinking and planning carefully. For example, a manager must decide how to divide tasks and assign them to the right people, considering everyone's skills.

### **S - Span of Control**
This refers to the number of employees a manager can supervise effectively. For example, one manager may handle a small team of 5 people, while another may manage 20 depending on the work type.

### **H - Human & Social Process**
Organising is not just about tasks, it’s about people too. It considers how people interact and work together. For example, when assigning tasks, a manager will think about who works well together to avoid conflicts.

# `# Process of Organising: `

### **2.2.3 Process of Organising** - **"TAGER"**
1. **T - Tasks Grouped**  
   Similar tasks are grouped together to make work more efficient. For example, in a hospital, doctors are grouped in one department and nurses in another.
   
2. **A - Assign Roles**  
   After grouping, specific roles are assigned to people based on their skills. In a restaurant, chefs are assigned to the kitchen, and servers take care of customers.

3. **G - Goals Identified**  
   Before organizing, the goals must be clear. For example, if a company wants to expand, the goal is to increase sales or production.

4. **E - Establish Relationships**  
   Relationships are set to show who reports to whom. For example, in a retail store, sales staff report to a store manager.

5. **R - Review and Adjust**  
   The process is reviewed regularly, and adjustments are made if needed. For instance, if a team is too small to handle a big project, more people may be added.

# `# Need and Importance of Organising: `

### **2.2.4 Need and Importance of Organising** - **"GRACE"**
1. **G - Growth**  
   Organising helps the company grow by using resources more efficiently. For example, a growing startup can organize teams to handle marketing, sales, and operations separately.

2. **R - Resource Allocation**  
   It helps in allocating resources like money, time, and people to the right tasks. For example, organizing ensures that the budget is spent properly in different departments.

3. **A - Adaptability**  
   Good organizing allows the business to adapt to changes in the market. For example, if a new competitor appears, the company can reorganize its strategy to stay competitive.

4. **C - Clarity**  
   Organising brings clarity to everyone’s roles and responsibilities, so there is no confusion. For example, in a school, teachers know they are responsible for teaching, not managing the school budget.

5. **E - Efficiency**  
   Organising ensures tasks are done efficiently, reducing waste of time and resources. For example, a well-organized factory produces goods faster with fewer errors.

# `# Principles of Organising: `

### **2.2.5 Principles of Organising** - **"SCARED"**
1. **S - Span of Control**  
   This principle defines how many people a manager can effectively supervise. For example, a team leader may manage five people, while a department head could oversee several teams.

2. **C - Coordination**  
   All parts of the organization should work together smoothly. For example, in a film production, the director, camera crew, and actors must coordinate to create a successful movie.

3. **A - Authority and Responsibility**  
   There must be a balance between the authority given and the responsibility expected. For instance, a manager given the responsibility for a project should have the authority to make decisions.

4. **R - Responsibility**  
   Everyone should know what they are responsible for. For example, in a bank, the cashier is responsible for handling money, while the manager oversees daily operations.

5. **E - Efficiency**  
   The structure should help the organization work as efficiently as possible. For example, an efficient assembly line in a car factory ensures faster production.

6. **D - Division of Work**  
   Work is divided into tasks, and each task is given to the right person or department. For example, in a software company, one team handles coding while another handles design.
