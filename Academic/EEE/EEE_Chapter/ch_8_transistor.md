# Transistors:

A transistor consists of two pn junctions formed by *sandwiching either p-type or n-type semiconductor between a pair of opposite types. Accordingly, there are two types of transistors, namely;
(i) n-p-n transistor (ii) p-n-p transistor

An n-p-n transistor is composed of two n-type semiconductors separated by a thin section of ptype as shown in Fig. 8.1 (i). However, a p-n-p transistor is formed by two p-sections separated by a
thin section of n-type as shown in Fig. 8.1 (ii).

# Naming the Transistor Terminals:

A transistor (pnp or npn) has three sections of doped semiconductors. The section on one side is the
emitter and the section on the opposite side is the collector. The middle section is called the base and
forms two junctions between the emitter and collector.

i)  **Emitter:** The section on one side that supplies charge carriers (electrons or holes) is
called the emitter. The emitter is always forward biased w.r.t. base so that it can supply a
large number of *majority carriers. In Fig. 8.2 (i), the emitter (p-type) of pnp transistor is forward
biased and supplies hole charges to its junction with the base.

ii) **Collector:** The section on the other side that collects the charges is called the collector. The
collector is always reverse biased w.r.t. base. 

iii) **Base:** The middle section which forms two pn-junctions between the emitter and collector
is called the base.
