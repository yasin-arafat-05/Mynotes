# Rate of flow
The rate of flow of fluid refers to the volume of fluid that passes through a particular point in a given amount of time. It is commonly measured in units such as liters per second, cubic meters per hour, gallons per minute, etc., depending on the specific application and region.

The general formula for calculating the rate of flow (Q) is:

$\[ Q = A \times V \]$

where:
- $\( Q \)$ is the rate of flow,
- $\( A \)$ is the cross-sectional area through which the fluid is flowing,
- $\( V \)$ is the velocity of the fluid.
